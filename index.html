											<h3 class="major">Project 3 - Data Analytics (SQL)</h3>
											<p>Data analytics distinguishes itself from data analysis because it tells you what to do and what the result will be. 
												Goal: Purpose How can we create a recommendation system? How can we categorize our customers and take actions separately for each group? How can we identify objects based on specific properties? All these questions can be answered using data analysis techniques. Result: By using statistics, programming, and machine learning techniques, I can find patterns hidden in the data. With this information I can make an algorithm, probability estimation or statistical model which you can use to make the right decisions.
